Linux on Windows dream setup with VMware. My goal was to have the benefits of Linux distributions like their command line with Windows. It should also include a shared folder so you can share files seamlessly between Windows and Linux. In this guide I will walk you through how you can build your own one-click portal to the world of Linux and close it as easily as you open it.
